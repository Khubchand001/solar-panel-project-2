  <h2> <a href="https://solarrooftop.gov.in//">Central Rooftop Scheme</a></h2>
  <p>
    The governmental body, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy(MNRE) has sanctioned 10 MW capacity to each BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL), and Tata Power Delhi Distribution (TPDDL). It encourages people to switch to solar energy and reduce the use of fossil-fuel-based electricity making buildings self-sustainable from the point of electricity. The scheme with an aggregate capacity of 10 MWP in each power distribution company ensures the installation of grid-connected to roof-top solar PV projects. The subsidy on the solar panels is available broadly in many categories

  <p>
    The Indian Government solar panel scheme in Karnataka is a bit different than other states. This scheme is called ‘Surya Raitha (Solar pump) subsidy scheme. If a farmer uses a solar pump in their field for farming activities the state government will provide subsidies to farmers. These pumps are approx 1.5 times more efficient than usual pumps and reduce the supply by approx 1/3rd of the total energy.

  <p>
    Rajasthan is the largest state of India by area and is home to many beautiful cities like Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Jaipur. It is also one of the leading states when it comes to solar p0ower, with more than 1381 MW of solar power already in use. Additionally, 47.1 MW was added to the grid in FY 16-17. To promote the adoption of solar power, the state government announced its solar energy policy in 2014 to add 25,000 MW in Rajasthan. Net metering has been announced to promote rooftop generation.

  <p>
   Although UP is still a developing state, it is facilitated well with high solar radiation. The future of solar power in UP is bright as the state is looking to set up solar parks in different parts of the state. UP stands 7th with the highest installed rooftop solar power generation capacity in India.  UP falls under the states of general category that gets up to 70% of the predetermined installation cost.</p>
